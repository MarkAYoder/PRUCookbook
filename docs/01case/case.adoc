== Case Studies - Introduction

It's an exciting time to be making projects that use embedded processors.  
Make:'s https://makezine.com/comparison/boards/[Makers' Guide to Boards] shows
many of the options that are available and groups them into different types.  
_Single board computers_ (SBCs) generally run Linux on some sort of https://www.arm.com/[ARM]
processor.  Examples are the BeagleBoard and the Raspberry Pi.  Another type
is the _microcontroller_, of which the https://www.arduino.cc/[Arduino] is 
popular.  

The SBCs are used because they have an operating system to manage files, I/O, 
and schedule when things are run, all while possibly talking to the Internet.  
Microcontrollers shine when things 
being interfaced require careful timing and can't afford to have an OS preempt an 
operation.

But what if you have a projcet that needs the flexibility of an OS and the timing 
of a microcontroller?  This is where the BeagleBoard excells since it has both 
an ARM procssor running Linux and two footnote:[Four if you are on the BeagleBone AI];
**P**rogrammable **R**eal-Time **U**nits (PRUs).
The PRUs have 32-bit cores which run
independently of the ARM processor, therefore they can
be programmed to respond quickly to inputs and produce very precisely timed 
outputs. 

* TODO Update link

There are many projects that use the PRU (http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU_Projects) to do things that can't be 
done with just a SBC or just a microcontroller. Here we present some case studies that give a high-level view of using the PRUs.  In later
chapters you will see the details of how they work.

=== Robotics Control Library
Robotics is an embedded application that often requires both an SBC to control the 
high-level tasks (such as path planning, line following, communicating with the user)
_and_ a microcontroller to handle the low-level tasks (such as telling motors how fast
to turn, or how to balance in response to an IMU input).  The 
https://www.ucsdrobotics.org/edumip[EduMIP] balancing 
https://www.hackster.io/edumip/edumip-13a29c[robot] 
demonstrates that by using the PRU, the Blue can handle both the high 
and low -level tasks without an additional microcontroller. The EduMIP is shown 
in <<case_blue>>.

The http://strawsondesign.com/docs/roboticscape/[Robotics Control Library] is a 
package that is already installed on the Blue, Black and Pocket, 

* TODO AI too?

that contains a C library and example/testing programs. It uses the PRU to extend the 
real-time hardware of the Bone by adding eight addional servo channels and one 
addition real-time encoder input.

The following examples show how easy it is to use the PRU for robotics.

==== Controlling Eight Servos
===== Problem
You need to control eight servos, but the Bone doesn't have enough pulse width 
modulation (PWM) channels
and you don't want to add hardware.  

===== Solution
The Robotics Control Library provides eight additional PWM channels via the PRU that can be used out of the box. 

[NOTE]
====
The I/O pins on the Beagles have a mutliplexer that lets you select what I/O 
appears on a given pin.  The Blue has the mux already configured to to run these
examples.  Follow the instructions in 
<<../03details/details.adocs#details_configure_servos, Configuring Pins for Controlling Servos>> 
to configure the pins for the Black and the Pocket.

----
bone$ *sudo rc_test_servos -f 10 -p 1.5*
----

The `-f 10` says to use a frequency of 10 Hz and the `-p 1.5` says to set the position to `1.5`.  The range of positions is
`-1.5` to `1.5`.   Run `rc_test_servos -h` to see all the options.

Be default the PRUs are already loaded with the code needed to run the
servos.  All you have to do is run the command.

//[/opt/source/Robotics_Cape_Installer/pru_firmware/src/pru1-servo.asm]

==== Controlling Individual Servos
===== Problem
`rc_test_servos` is nice, but I need to control the servos individually.

===== Solution
You can modify `rc_test_servos.c`.  You'll find it on the bone at
`/opt/source/Robotics_Cape_Installer/examples/src/rc_test_servos.c`, or online at
<https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/Robotics_Cape_Installer/blob/master/examples/src/rc_test_servos.c>.

Just past line 250 you'll find a `while` loop that has calls to `rc_servo_send_pulse_normalized(ch,servo_pos)` and
`rc_servo_send_pulse_us(ch, width_us)`.  The first call sets the pulse width relative to the pulse period; the other
sets the width to an absolute time.  Use whichever works for you.

==== Controlling More Than Eight Channels
===== Problem
I need more than eight PWM channels, or I need less jitter on the off time.

===== Solution
This is a more advanced problem and required reprograming the PRUs.  See 
<<../05blocks/blocks.html#blocks_pwm, PWM Generator>> for an example.
// ToDo, fill in XXXXX


==== Reading Hardware Encoders
===== Problem
I want to use four encoders to measure four motors, but I only see hardware for three.

===== Solution
The forth encoder can be implemented on the PRU. If you run `rc_test_encoders_eqep` on the Blue, you will see the output of 
encoders E1-E3 which are connected to the eEQP hardware.

=== BeagleLogic - a 14-channel Logic Analyzer

==== Problem
I need a 100Msps, 14-channel logic analyzer

==== Solution
https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[BeagleLogic] is a 100Msps, 
14-channel logic analyzer that runs on the Beagle. 

[verse,https://github.com/abhishek-kakkar/BeagleLogic/wiki]
____
BeagleLogic turns your BeagleBone [Black] into a 14-channel, 100Msps Logic Analyzer. Once loaded, it presents itself as a character device node */dev/beaglelogic*.

The core of the logic analyzer is the 'beaglelogic' kernel module that reserves memory for and drives the two Programmable Real-Time Units (PRU) via the remoteproc interface wherein the PRU directly writes logic samples to the System Memory (DDR RAM) at the configured sample rate one-shot or continuously without intervention from the ARM core.
____

The quickest solution is to get the https://github.com/abhishek-kakkar/BeagleLogic/wiki/BeagleLogic-%22no-setup-required%22-setup:-Introducing-System-Image![no-setup-required image].  It runs on an older image (15-Apr-2016) but should still work.

If you want to be running a newer image, there are instructions on the site for https://beaglelogic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html[installing BeagleLogic], but I had to do the additional steps in <<case_installing_beaglelogic>>.

==== Discussion
BeagleLogic is a complete system that includes firmware for the PRUs, 
a kernel module and a web interface that create a powerful 100 MHz 
logic analyzer on the Bone with no additional hardware needed.

[TIP]
====
If you need buffered inputs, consider
http://standalone.beaglelogic.net/en/latest/[BeagleLogic Standalone],
a turnkey Logic Analyzer built on top of BeagleLogic.
====

The kernel interface makes it easy to control the PRUs through the
command line.  For example

[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *dd if=/dev/beaglelogic of=mydump bs=1M count=1*

will capture a binary dump from the PRUs. The sample rate and number of 
bits per sample can be controlled through `/sys/`.

BeagleLogic uses the two PRUs to sample at 100Msps.  Getting a PRU running at 200Hz to sample at 100Msps is a slick trick.

any other type of 
https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf[WS2812 LED]
and want to light it up.

==== Solution
You can either write your own code 
(See <<../05blocks/blocks.adoc#blocks_ws2812, WS2812 Driver>>), or
use https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/LEDscape[LEDscape] which
is a library for controlling NeoPixels using http://openpixelcontrol.org/[Open 
Pixel Control].

[verse, https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/LEDscape]
____
LEDscape is a library and service for controlling individually addressable LEDs from a Beagle Bone Black or Beagle Bone Green using the onboard PRUs. It currently supports WS281x (WS2811, WS2812, WS2812b), WS2801 and initial support for DMX.

It can support up to 48 connected strings and can drive them with very little load on the main processor.

Background
LEDscape was originally written by Trammell Hudson (http://trmm.net/Category:LEDscape) for controlling WS2811-based LEDs. Since his original work, his version (https://github.com/osresearch/LEDscape) has been repurposed to drive a different type of LED panel (e.g. http://www.adafruit.com/products/420).

This version of the library was forked from his original WS2811 work. Various improvements have been made in the attempt to make an accessible and powerful LED driver based on the BBB. Many thanks to Trammell for his excellent work in scaffolding the BBB and PRUs for driving LEDs.
____

LEDscape can drive 48 strings of LEDs that are arbitary length with no addional
hardware!  Here's how to install it.

[NOTE]
====
LEDscape uses UIO, an older method for talking to the PRU.  See
<<../06io/io.adoc#io_uio,Configuring for UIO Instead of RemoteProc>> to configure your Bone to use UIO.
====

First install LEDscape and openpixelcontrol.

LEDscape supports up to 48 channels (strings) of LEDs.  The above table shows 
how the channel numbers map to BeagleBone Black pins.  We'll use channel 0 
which maps to P9_22. Wire your LED string to P9_22.

You should now see "a pleasing pattern of rotating color hues".  

==== Discussion
LEDscape is higly configurable.  When you run `opc-server` it first prints out 
its configuration.  If it doesn't receive any data after three seconds it 
will go into demo mode.  In this configuration, `demoMode` is set to `fade` 
which produces the nice pattern you are seeing.  (You can set `demoMode` 
to `none` if you would rather not see anything.  See README.md for
other options.)

Notice it's currently configured to drive 48 strings (`usedStripCount`) with 
176 LEDS (`ledsPerStrip`). It's also set to interpolate (`enableInterpolation`) 
colors, that is, rather than abruptly switching to a new color, it will 
smoothly fade between the two.  With this configuration it uses about 26% 
of the ARM CPU.

Let's write a configuration file that fits our LEDs string. Copy the default
configuration and edit it.

[source]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *cp configs/ws281x-config.json my-config.json*
----
Now edit it to match <<case_config>>.

[[case_config]]
.my-config.json
[source]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/my-config.json[]
----

Run this with:
[source]
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *sudo ./opc-server --config my-config.json*
----

Now we are only using about 7% of the ARM CPU.

You can now run a program that sends data to the string.  <<case_circle>> is 
a simple python example that sequencies an LED through the entire string.  It 
uses `opc.py` which is included in the `code` directory.

===== Hardware
The Beagle hardware can be either a BeagleBone Black with the 
https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/7mSHNZcD[Octoscroller Cape], or a 
PocketBeagle with the 
https://www.hackster.io/daniel-kulp/pocketscroller-led-panel-cape-for-pocketbeagle-fe12a6[PocketScroller LED Panel Cape]. 
(See https://www.tindie.com/products/dkulp/pocketscroller-led-panel-cape-for-pocketbeagle/[to purchase].)
https://www.diychristmas.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_an_Octoscroller_Matrix_Display[Building and Octoscroller Matrix Display] 
gives details for using the BeagleBone Black. 

<<case_pocket>> shows how to attach the PocketBeagle to the P5 LED matrix 
and where to attach the 5V power.  If you are going to turn on all the LEDs 
to full white at the same time you will need at least a 4A supply.

===== Software
The FPP software is most easily installed by downloading the 
http://dankulp.com/bbb/[current FPP image], flashing an SD card and 
booting from it. 

[TIP]
====
The really brave can install it on a already running image.  See details at
<https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/blob/master/SD/FPP_Install.sh>

===== xLights - Creating Content for the Display

Once you are sure your LED Matrix is working correctly you can program it 
with a sequence.  
[verse, https://xlights.org/]
____
xLights is a free and open source program that enables you to design, create and play amazing lighting displays through the use of DMX controllers, E1.31 Ethernet controllers and more.

With it you can layout your display visually then assign effects to the various items throughout your sequence. This can be in time to music (with beat-tracking built into xLights) or just however you like.
xLights runs on Windows, OSX and Linux
____
xLights can be installed on your host computer (not the Beagle) by
following instructions at 
<https://code.launchpad.net/~chris-debenham/+archive/ubuntu/xlights>.

Run xLights and you'll see <<case_xlights_setup>>.

[[case_xlights_setup]]
.xLights Setup
image::figures/xlights_setup.png[xLights Setup]

We'll walk you through a simple setup to get an animation to display on the 
RGB Matrix.  xLights can use a protocol called E1.31 to send information to 
the display.  Setup xLights by clicking on *Add E1.31* and entering the values 
shown in <<case_xlights_setup_e1_31>>.

[[case_xlights_setup_e1_31]]
.Setting Up E1.31
image::figures/xlights_setup_e1_31.png[Setting Up E1.31]

The *IP Address* is the Bone's address as seen from the host computer. 
Each LED is one channel, so one RGB LED is three channels.  The P5 board 
has 3*64*32 or 6144 channels.  These are grouped into universes of 512 
channels each.  This gives 6144/512 = 12 universes. See the 
https://www.doityourselfchristmas.com/wiki/index.php?title=E1.31_(Streaming-ACN)_Protocol#Configuring_Sequencing_Software_to_use_E1.31_Output[E.13 documentation] 
for more details.

Your setup should look like <<case_xlights_setup_done>>.  Click the
*Save Setup* button to save.

[[case_xlights_setup_done]]
.xLights setup for P5 display
image::figures/xlights_setup_done.png[xLights setup for P5 display]

Next click on the *Layout* tab.  Click on the *Matrix* button as shown in 
<<case_xlights_matrix>>, then click on the black area where you want your 
matrix to appear.

[[case_xlights_matrix]]
.Setting up the Matrix Layout

[[case_xlights_layout_details]]
.Layout details for P5 matrix
image::figures/xlights_layout_details.png[Layout details for P5 matrix]

All I changed was *# Strings*, *Nodes/String*, *Starting Location* and most 
importantly, expand *String Properties* and select at *String Type* of 
*RGB Nodes*.  Above the seeting you should see that *Start Chan* is 1 and 
the *End Chan* is 6144, which is the total number of individual LEDs (3*63*32). 
xLights now knows we are working with a P5 matrix, now on to the sequencer. 

Now click on the *Sequencer* tab and then click on the *New Sequence* button
(<<case_seq_new>>).

[[case_seq_new]]
.Starting a new sequence
image::figures/xlights_seq_new.png[Starting a new sequence]

Then click on *Animation*, *20fps (50ms)*, and *Quick Start*. Learning how to 
do sequences is beyond the scope of this cookbook, however I'll shown you how
do simple sequence just to be sure xLights is talking to the Bone.

===== Setting Up E1.31 on the Bone
First we need to setup FPP to take input from xLights.  Do this by going to 
the *Input/Output Setup* menu and selecting *Channel Inputs*.  Then 
enter *12* for *Universe Count* and click *set* and you will see 
<<case_inputs_setup>>.

[[case_inputs_setup]]
.E1.31 Bridge Mode Universes
image::figures/fpp_inputs_setup.png[.E1.31 Bridge Mode Universes]

Click on the *Save* button above the table.  Then go to the *Status Control* 
menu and select *Status Page*.  Set the *FPPD Mode:* to *Bridge* as shown 
in <<case_mode_bridge>>.

[[case_mode_bridge]]
.Bridge Mode
image::figures/fpp_mode_bridge.png[Bridge Mode]

===== Testing the xLights Connection
The Bone is now listening for commands from xLights via the E1.31 protocol.
A quick way to verify everything is t o return to xLights and go to the 
*Tools* menu and select *Test* (<<case_xlights_test>>).  

[[case_xlights_test]]
.xLights test page
image::figures/xlights_test.png[xLights test page]

Click the box under *Select channels...*, click *Output to lights* and 
select *Twinkle 50%*.  You matrix should have a colorful twinkle pattern
(<<case_xlights_twinkle>>).

[[case_xlights_twinkle]]
.xLights Twinkle test pattern
image::figures/xlights_twinkle.jpg[xLights Twinkle test pattern]

===== A Simple xLights Sequence
Now that the xLights to FPP link is tested you can generate a sequence to 
play.  Close the Test window and click on the *Sequencer* tab.  Then drag 
an effect from the *Effects* box to the timeline that below it.  Drop it to 
the right of the *Matrix* label (<<case_seq_drag>>).  The click 
*Output To Lights* which is the yellow lightbulb to the right on the top 
toolbar.  Your matrix should now be displaying your effect.

[[case_seq_drag]]
.Drag an effect to the timeline
image:figures/xlights_seq_drag.png[Drag an effect to the timeline]

The setup requires the host computer to send the animation data to the Bone. 
The next section shows how to save the sequence and play it on the Bone 
standalone.

===== Saving a Sequence and Playing it Standalone
In xLights save your sequence by hitting Ctrl-S and giving it a name.  I called 
mine *fire* since I used a fire effect.  Now, switch back to FPP and select 
the *Content Setup* menu and select *File Manager*.  Click the blue
*Select Files* button and select your sequence file that ends in *.fseq*
(<<case_file_manager>>).

[[case_file_manager]]
.FPP file manager
image:figures/fpp_file_manager.png[FPP file manager]

Once your sequence is uploaded, got to *Content Steup* and select *Playlists*. 
Enter you playlist name (I used *fire*) and click *Add*.  Then go down to 
the *New Playlist Entry* section and select *Sequence Only* 
(<<case_playlist>>), then click *Add*. 

[[case_playlist]]
.Adding a new playlist to FPP
image::figures/fpp_playlist.png[Adding a new playlist to FPP]

Be sure to click *Save* under *Playlist Details*. Now return to 
*Status/Control* and *Status Page* and make sure *FPPD Mode:* is set 
to *Player (Standalone)*.  You should see your playlist.  Click the *Play* 
button at the bottom of the page and your sequence will play.

The beauty of the PRU is that the Beagle can play a detailed sequence at 
20 frames per second and the ARM procossor is only 15% used.  The PRUs 
are doing all the work.
