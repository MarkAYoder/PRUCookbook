== More Performance

So far in all our examples we've been able to meet our timing goals by writing
our code in the C programming language. The C compiler does a suprisingly
good job at generating code, most the time.  However there are times
when very precise timing is needed and the compiler isn't doing it.

At these times you need to write in assembly language.  This chapter
introduces the PRU assembler and shows how to call assembly code from
C. Detailing on how to program in assembly are beyond the scope of this text.

The following are resources used in this chapter.

=== Calling Assembly from C
==== Problem
You have some C code and you want to call an assembly language routine from
it.

==== Solution
You need to do two things, write the assembler file and modify the `Makefile`
to include it. For example, let's write our own `my_delay_cycles` routine in
in assembly.  The intrinsic `pass:[__]delay_cycles` must be passed a compile time
constant.  Our new `delay_cycles` can take a runtime delay value.

<<more_delay-test>> is much like our other c code, but on line 10 we declare 
`my_delay_cycles` and then on lines 24 and 26 we'll call it with an argument
of 1.
[[more_delay-test]]

<<more_delay>> is the assembly code.
[[more_delay]]
.delay.pru0.asm
[source,c,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/delay.pru0.asm[]
----

The `Makefile` has one addition that needs to be made to compile both <<more_delay-test>>
and <<more_delay>>.
If you look in the local `Makefile` you'll see:
[[more_makefile]]
.Makefile
[source,makefile]
----
include::code/Makefile[]
----

This Makefle includes a common Makfile at  `/var/lib/cloud9/common/Makefile`,
this the Makefile you need to edit. 
Edit `/var/lib/cloud9/common/Makefile` and go to line 197.

	@echo 'LD	$^'
	$(eval $(call target-to-proc,$@))
	$(eval $(call proc-to-build-vars,$@))
	@$(LD) $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS) 
----
Add `*(GEN_DIR)/$(TARGETasm).o*` as shown in bold above.  You will want to remove
this addition once you are done with this example since it will break the other examples.

The following will compile and run everything.
[source,bash]

The resulting output is shown in <<more_my_delay_cycles>>.

.Output of my_delay_cycles()
image:figures/my_delay_cycles.png[Output of my_delay_cycles()]

Notice the on time is about 35ns and the off time is 30ns.

==== Discission
There is much to explain here.  Let's start with <<more_delay>>.

.Line-by-line of delays.asm
[cols="1,9"]
|===
|Line |Explanation

|3    |Declare `my_delay_cycles` to be global so the linker can find it.
|4    |Label the starting point for `my_delay_cycles`.
|5    |Label for our delay loop.
|6    |The first argument is passed in register `r14`.  Page 111 of
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhv7b/spruhv7b.pdf[PRU Optimizing C/C++ Compiler, v2.2, User's Guide]
gives the argument passing convention.  Registers `r14` to `r29` are used
to pass arguments, if there are more arguments, the argument stack (`r4`)
is used.  The other register conventions are found on page 108.

Here we subtract 1 from `r14` and save it back into `r14`.
|7    |`qbne` is a quick branch if not equal.
|9    |Once we've delayed enough we drop through the quick branch and 
hit the jump.  The upper bits of register `r3` has the return address,
therefore we return to the c code.
|===

<<more_my_delay_cycles>> shows the _on_ time is 35ns and the off time is 30ns.
With 5ns/cycle this gives 7 cycles on and 6 off. These times make sense 
because each instruction takes a cycle and you have, set `R30`, jump to
`my_delay_cycles`, `sub`, `qbne`, `jmp`. Plus the instruction (not seen) that
initilizes `r14` to the passed value.  That's a total of six instructions.
The extra instruction is the branch at the bottom of the `while` loop.


=== Returning a Value from Assembly
==== Problem
Your assembly code needs to return a value.

==== Solution
`R14` is how the return value is passed back.  <<more_test2>> shows the c
code.

[[more_test2]]
.delay-test2.pru0.c
[source,c,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/delay-test2.pru0.c[]

<<more_delay2>> is the assembly code.
[[more_delay2]]
.delay2.pru0.asm
[source,c,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/delay2.pru0.asm[]
----

An additional feature is shown in line 4 of <<more_delay2>>.  The
`.cdecls "delay-test2.pru0.c"` says to include any defines from `delay-test2.pru0.c`
In this example, line 6 of <<more_test2>> `#defines` TEST and line 12 of 
<<more_delay2>> reference it.


=== Using the Built-In Counter for Timing
==== Problem
I want to count how many cycles my routine takes.

==== Solution
Each PRU has a `CYCLE` register which counts the number of cycles since
the PRU was enabled. They also have a `STALL` register that counts how
many times the PRU stalled fetching an instruction.
<<more_cycle>> shows they are used.

[[more_cycle]]
.cycle.pru0.c - Code to count cycles.
[source,c,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/cycle.pru0.c[]
----

==== Discission
The code is mostly the same as other examples. 
`cycle` and `stall` end up in registers which
we can read using prudebug.
<<more_cycle_lines>> is the Line-by-line.

[[more_cycle_lines]]
[cols="1,9"]
.Line-by-line for cycle.pru0.c
|===
|Line|Explanation

|4   |Include needed to reference `CYCLE` and `STALL`. 
|16  |Declaring `cycle` and `stall`.  The compiler will optimize these and just
keep them in registers.  We'll have to look at the `cycle.pru0.lst` file to see where
they are stored.
|21  |Enables `CYCLE`.
|26  |Reset `CYCLE`. It ignores the value assigned to it and always sets it
to 0.  `cycle` is on the right hand side to make the compiler give it it's own
register.
|28, 29|Reads the `CYCLE` and `STALL` values into registers.
|===

You can see where `cycle` and `stall` are stored by looking into 
<<more_cycle_list0>>.
[[more_cycle_list0]]
./tmp/cloud9-examples/cycle.pru0.lst Lines 113..119
[source,asm,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/cycle.pru0.lst[lines=113..119]
----
Here the `LDI32` instruction loads the address `0x22000` into `r0`.  
This is the offset to the `CTRL` registers. 
 Later in the file we see <<more_cycle_list1>>.
 
[[more_cycle_list1]]
./tmp/cloud9-examples/cycle.pru0.lst Lines 146..152
[source,asm,linenums]
[subs=+quotes]
----
include::code/cycle.pru0.lst[lines=146..152]
----
The first `LBBO` takes the contents of `r0` and adds the offset 12 to it and
copies 4 bytes into `r1`.  This points to `CYCLE`, so `r1` has the contents of
`CYCLE`.

The second `LBBO` does the same, but with offset 16, which points to `STALL`,
thus `STALL` is now  in `r0`.

Now fire up ((prudebug)) and look at those registers.

----
So `cycle` is 3 and `stall` is 5. It must be one cycle to clear the GPIO
and 2 cycles to read the `CYCLE` register and save it in the register. 
It's interesting there are 5 `stall` cycles. 

If you switch the order of
lines 30 and 31 you'll see `cycle` is 7 and `stall` is 2. `cycle` now
includes the time needed to read `stall` and `stall` no longer includes
the time to read `cycle`.



=== Xout and Xin - Transfering Between PRUs
==== Problem
I need to transfer data between PRUs quickly.

==== Solution
The `pass:[__]xout()` and `pass:[__]xin()` intrinsics are able to transfer up to 30 registers between
PRU 0 and PRU 1 quickly.  <<more_xout>> shows how `xout()` running on PRU 0 
transfers six registers to PRU 1.
