== Moving to the BeagleBone AI

So far all our examples have focussed on the BeagleBone Black and Pocket Beagle.
These are both based on the am335x chip.  The new kid on the black in the BeagleBone AI
which is based on the am5729. The new chip brings with it new capabilities one of
which is four PRUs.  This chapter details what changes when moving from two to
four PRUs.

The following are resources used in this chapter.

=== Moving from two to four PRUs
==== Problem
You have code that works on the am335x PRUs and you want to move it to the 
am5729 on the AI.

==== Solution
Things to consider when moving to the AI are:

* Which pins are you going to use
* Which PRU are you going to run on

Knowing which pins to use impacts the PRU you'll use.

==== Discission
The various System Reference Manuals (SRM's) list which pins go to the PRUs.
Here the tables are combined into one to make it easier to see what goes where.

The pins in *bold* are already configured as pru pins.  See <<ai_config>> to
see what's currently configured as what.  See <<ai_device_tree>> to 
configure pins.

[[ai_config]]
=== Seeing how pins are configured
==== Problem
You want to know how the pins are currently configured.

==== Solution
The `show-pins.pl` command does what you want, but you have to set it up first.

[source] 
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *cd ~/bin*
bone$ *ln -s /opt/scripts/device/bone/show-pins.pl .*
----

This creates a symbolic link to the `show-pins.pl` command that is rather hidden
away.  The link is put in the `bin` directory which is in the default command
`$PATH`.  Now you can run `show-pins.pl` from anywhere.

[source]

bone$ *show-pins.pl*

...
----
Here you see `P9.19a` and `P9.20a` are configured for i2c with pull up resistors.
The `P8` pins are configured as gpio with pull down resistors. They are 
both on gpio port 3.  `P8.35b` is bit 0 while `P8.33b` is bit 1. You can find
which direction they are set by using `gpioinfo` and the chip number.  
Unfortunately you subtract one from the port number to get the chip number.
So `P8.35b` is on chip number 2.

Here we have nine pins configured for the PRU registers `R30` and `R31`.
Five are input pins and four are out.


[[ai_device_tree]]
=== Configuring pins on the AI via device trees
==== Problem
I want to configure another pin for the PRU, but I get an error.
[source] 
[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *config-pin P9_31 pruout*
ERROR: open() for /sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp:P9_31_pinmux/state failed, No such file or directory
----

==== Solution
The pins on the AI must be configure at boot time and therefor cannot be
configured with `config-pin`.  Instead you must edit the device tree.

==== Discission
Suppose you want to make `P9_31` a PRU output pin. First go to the
https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-ai/wiki/System-Reference-Manual#p8.10-p8.13[am5729 System Reference Manual]
and look up `P9_31`.  
[TIP]
====
The https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFSBVem86vAUD7MLXvqdS-N0Efi8_g_O1iTqzql8DAo/edit#gid=0[BeagleBone AI PRU pins]
table may be easier to use.
====

`P9_31` appears twice, as `P9_31a` and `P9_31b`. Either should work, let's pick
`P9_31a`.
[WARNING]
====
When you have two internal pins attached to the same header (either P8 or P9)
make sure only one is configured as an output.  If both are outputs, you could
damage the AI.
====
We see that when `P9_31a` is set to `MODE13` it will be a PRU _out_ pin.  
`MODE12` makes it a PRU _in_ pin.  It appears at bit 10 on PRU2_1.

Next, find which kernel you are running.

There it is.  `P9_31` is now a PRU output pin on PRU1_0, bit 3.


[[ai_using_pru_pins]]
=== Using the PRU pins
==== Problem
Once I have the PRU pins configured on the AI how do I use them?

==== Solution
In <<ai_device_tree>> we configured `P9_31a` to be a PRU pin.  `show-pins.pl` showed
that it appears at `pr2_pru1_gpo10`, which means pru2_1 accesses it using
bit 10 of register `R30`.

==== Discission
It's easy to modify the pwm example from <<blocks_pwm>> to use this pin.
First copy the example you want to modify to `pwm1.pru2_1.c`.  The `pru2_1` in
the file name tells the Makefile to run the code on pru2_1.  <<ai_pwm1>> shows
the adapted code.

[[ai_pwm1]]
.pwm1.pru2_1.c
[source,c,linenums] 
----
include::code/pwm1.pru2_1.c[]
----

One line 6 `P9_31` is defined as `(0x1<<10)`, which means shift `1` over by 10 bits.
That's the only change needed.  Copy the local Makefile to the same directory and
compile and run.

[subs=+quotes]
----
bone$ *make TARGET=pwm1.pru2_1*

Attach an LED to `P9_31` and it should be blinking.
