|Interacto    |A cape making BeagleBone interactive with a triple-axis accelerometer, 
gyroscope and magnetometer plus a 640 x 480/30 fps camera. 
All sensors are digital and communicate via I²C to the BeagleBone. 
The camera frames are captured using the PRU-ICSS. The sensors on this cape 
give hobbyists and students a starting point to easily build robots and flying drones. |Project 1    |http://beagleboard.org/CapeContest/entries/Interacto/
